# Transcendent Entity

## About

Transcendent Entity is a C++ standalone entity-componant system designed primarily for use in [Transcendent-Engine](https://github.com/sammyboy0110/Transcendent-Engine), however it can be used by any C++ application where it would be suitable.

## About me

I am a school student who is interested in programming. I made this engine as a learning project. The development has taught me a lot regarding source control, graphics programming and even logic in the importance of the order of functions.

## The future

I plan on updating this repository for as long as possible, continuously adding features to help make the ECS as good as possible.

## A massive thank you goes out to Harriet Chard for providing all of the artwork
